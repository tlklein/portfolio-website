  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <section aria-labelledby="about-heading">
    <h2 id="about-heading">Howdy, I'm Trinity Klein!</h2>
    <p>I'm a recent graduate from the Cullen College of Engineering, with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems (CIS). I graduated <em>cum laude</em> in May 2025. My experience surrounds primarily cloud infrastructure, full-stack development, cybersecurity, and database management. I hold these certifications: <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/9ab1424b-f346-4461-a1b7-829dc8591cd9/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a> and <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/9d9b271b-094f-4a86-9403-78d9c5f66141/public_url" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cisco Data Analytics Essentials</a>.</p>
    <p>At Southeast Hypnosis, I led digital transformation initiatives through AI integration and workflow automation. From building and integrating an AI chatbot to boost client conversions to designing an automated reminder funnel that reduces no-shows and cancellations, to migrating the website to WordPress for increased performance, I have seen firsthand the value technology brings to streamlining operations while advancing user experiences — even on a tight budget.</p>
    <p>Above all, my ultimate goal is to create innovative applications, practical systems, and projects with a lasting impact on their users' lives.</p>
