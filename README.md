## A RECENT GRAD'S GUIDE TO THE CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE

## CHUNK 0
The goal of this section is to get the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. I achieved it. Follow the this link, https://www.credly.com/badges/9ab1424b-f346-4461-a1b7-829dc8591cd9. 

## CHUNK 1
The goal of this section is to get my resume into HTML, style it with CSS, animate it using JavaScript, and finally place into a S3 bucket and secure it using CloudFront. I used a hugo theme called console. It is simple, minimalistic and models the look of a Linux console. It is made with website performance in mind having a load time around 55ms.

## CHUNK 2
The goal of this section is to get a visitor counter, or more accurately a hit counter on my portfolio website using a database that is not DynamoDB.
